 *
 * For each text portion, one of the methods text(...) or special(...)
 * is called, depending on whether it is a 'normal' run of text, or
 * any other portion. Additionally, the linebreak() method is called
 * once at the end of every on-screen line.
 *
 * All parameters relate to the 'model string', which is the text string
 * held by the corresponding SwTxtNode.
 *
 * The SwPortionHandler can be used with the
 * SwTextFrame::VisitPortions(...) method.
