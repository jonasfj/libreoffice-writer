/** class for an observable thread

    Note: A thread is ref-counted. Thus, an instance of a derived class has to
    to be hold via a reference. The thread itself assures during its execution,
    that the ref-count is increased. Its execution starts with its <run()> method
    and ends with its <onTerminated()> method.
    Note: A thread can be only observed by one or none thread observer in order
    to notify, that the thread has finished its work.
