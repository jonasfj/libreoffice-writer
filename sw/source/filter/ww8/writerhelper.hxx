            The rest of Office uses SdrOle2Obj for their OLE objects, Writer
            doesn't, which makes things a bit difficult as this is the type of
            object that the escher import code shared by the MSOffice filters
            produces when it imports an OLE object. 
            
            This utility class takes ownership of the OLE object away from a
            SdrOle2Obj and can massage it into the condition best suited to
            insertion into Writer.

            If the object was not transferred into Writer then it is deleted
            during destruction.
